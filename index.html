                Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and<br> statistics show that 
                only 20% of them will find a family. The<br> others will continue 
                to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky<br> 
                chance to become dearly loved.
            </p>
            <p class="content-sub">
                We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they<br> do not get sick,
                feel comfortable (including psychologically) and<br> well. We are supported
                by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels.
                About 12% of the animals are taken by the<br> shelter staff.
                Taking care of the animals, they become attached<br>
                to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
